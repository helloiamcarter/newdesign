        <h2>Excess Fat</h2>
        <p>Excess fat is caused from genetics, medical conditions, poor diet and overall lifestyle choices. We understand it is tough to blast the stubborn belly fat, but at CanopyMD we now have the most innovative treatment option available!</p>
        <p>All the new <a href="vanquish.php">Vanquish treatment</a> is unique and pain-free as it works to cause death to fat cells through radiofrequency energy. Your body will then flush those cells out the lymphatic system, which is why adequate hydration before and after treatment is critical.</p>
        <p>Appointments take about an hour and are comfortable. All patients are photographed and weighed on our InBody scale that measures your hydration, fat percentages, and much more. Vanquish is revolutionary and we are proud to be one of the first in the world to own this highly advanced piece of equipment at CanopyMD. View our before & after photos!</p>
