				<h1>Spider Veins</h1>
				<p>Spider veins are commonly found on the face, thighs, ankles, and feet.</p>
				<p>Spider veins are caused by genetics, age, lifestyle, pregnancy, and occupation.</p>
				<p>These broken capillaries often are in clusters of red or pink veins with hues of blue or purple.</p>
				<p>At Canopy MD we use two different methods to improve these areas. We use our Clear Scan laser or Sclero injections to restrict blood flow in these specific areas resulting in the disappearance of spider veins a couple months after your treatment.</p>
				<p>Redness may last several months following your procedure.</p>
				<p>We also suggest you wear compression hose, minimize exercise, and elevate your feet as much as possible the first week after your treatment.</p>
				<p>Our team can help you determine which method is best for you through a free consultation at Canopy MD.</p>
