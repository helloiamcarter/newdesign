				<h1>Sagging Skin</h1>
				<p>Sagging skin results from aging and lack of collagen for support.</p>
				<p>Here at Canopy MD we offer treatments to create collagen to prevent new laxities from forming.</p>
				<p>Through a series of non-invasive Exilis treatments, we can tighten the skin while producing collagen.</p>
				<p>Now thatâ€™s what we call the best of both worlds!</p>
				<p>Exilis treatments are done in our office by our certified technicians and typically are performed in less than an hour.</p>
				<p>By using heat, collagen may be successfully recoiled resulting in a more youthful looking you.</p>
				<p>For your free consultation, contact Canopy MD today! View our before & after photos!</p>
